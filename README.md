# Meal Analysis App ðŸ¥—

This application allows users to upload an image of a meal and receive a detailed analysis, including the meal's name, preparation instructions, description, macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs), and optionally vitamins and minerals. The app leverages the OpenAI API to analyze meal data and provide a structured JSON response.

---

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of a meal for analysis.
- **Optional Vitamins and Minerals Analysis**: Users can check the vitamins and minerals checkboxes to include detailed micronutrient information.
- **Detailed Meal Information**:
  - Name of the meal
  - Description of the meal
  - Preparation instructions
  - Total calories and calories per item
  - Macronutrient breakdown (protein, fat, carbohydrates)
  - Vitamins and minerals (if requested)
- **JSON Output Parsing**: The OpenAI API responds with a JSON object, which the app parses and displays in a user-friendly format.

---

## Workflow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user uploads a meal image and optionally selects the vitamins and minerals checkboxes.
   - The user clicks the "Send" button.

2. **Client-Side Processing**:
   - A `fetch()` request sends the image data and the boolean values for vitamins and minerals to the Python Flask backend.

3. **Flask Backend**:
   - Flask prepares a detailed prompt and sends the data to the OpenAI API, specifying the desired JSON response format.

4. **OpenAI API**:
   - The OpenAI API analyzes the data and responds with a structured JSON object containing the requested meal information.

5. **Response Handling**:
   - The Flask backend sends the API's JSON response back to the client.
   - The client-side JavaScript parses the JSON and dynamically displays the information in the appropriate HTML tags.
